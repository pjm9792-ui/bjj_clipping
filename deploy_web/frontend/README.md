# BJJ Clip Library UI

Based on the Figma design:
https://www.figma.com/design/GI1jeoDNm1TVhMt655HXmH/BJJ-Clip-Library-UI-Design

## Running the UI

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm i
```

2. Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This UI expects a backend API at `/api/*` (proxied by Vite to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
